# Banking Administration System

## Overview

This project simulates a basic **Banking System**. It is designed as an internal system for a bank, where customers can open accounts, bank employees can manage these accounts, and various banking operations such as transactions, loans, and credit card management are carried out. The application is written in Java and models essential banking entities such as customers, employees, accounts, transactions, loans, and credit cards.

### Main Features:

1. **Customer Management**: Add and manage bank customers.
2. **Bank Accounts**: Customers can open and manage checking and savings accounts.
3. **Transactions**: Perform and manage transactions between accounts.
4. **Loans**: Issue and manage customer loans.
5. **Credit Cards**: Issue and manage credit cards for customers.
6. **Employee Management**: Manage bank employees and their roles within the bank.

### Functional Details:

- **Customer Accounts**: Customers can open different types of accounts (checking or savings). Each account tracks the balance and transaction history.
- **Bank Transactions**: The system supports transferring money between accounts, and ensuring that balances are updated appropriately.
- **Loans and Credit**: The bank offers loans with specific terms, and customers can also receive and manage credit cards with limits and interest rates.
- **Employee Roles**: Employees have different roles within the system, and their actions within the application are managed accordingly.

This project is a modular Java application that can be further expanded to support more features, such as external payment system integration or multi-currency support.
